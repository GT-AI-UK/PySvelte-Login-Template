# PySvelte Login Template
A template project for Python and Sveltekit with tailwind and DaisyUI preinstalled.

Setup (terminal):
1. clone the project and cd into it
2. cd to svelte_frontend
3. run `npm install`
4. cd to python_backend
5. run `python -m venv ./venv`
6. run `source ./venv/bin/activate`
